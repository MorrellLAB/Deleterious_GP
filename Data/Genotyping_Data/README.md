# Deleterious_GP/Data/Genotyping_Data
Genotyping data for Deleterious Mutations 2. 

Contains both [ALCHEMY](http://alchemy.sourceforge.net/) and curated genotype
calls for each cycle of the genomic prediction experiment. Also contains the
genetic map and GoldenPath (proxy for physical position) for each of the
genotyped SNPs from [HarvEST](http://harvest.ucr.edu/), according to the
consensus genetic map from [Muñoz-Amatriaín et al. 2011](https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/tpg/articles/4/3/238).

The parameters for running ALCHEMY are as follows:
- ALCHEMY v. 1.07
- SNP map and probe intensities exported by the GenomeStudio plugin
- Sample map generated by hand, with dummy values for sample ID
- Inbreeding coefficients set to 0.75, expectation after two selfs
- Using 40 SNPs to estimate actual inbreeding coefficient
- Using 10 start points in EM search for inbreeding coefficient
- Random seed set to 12345

The curated genotype calls were generated by K. Beaubien.
