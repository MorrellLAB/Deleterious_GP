# Deleterious_GP/Data/Genotyping_Data
Genotyping data for Deleterious Mutations 2. 

Contains both [ALCHEMY](http://alchemy.sourceforge.net/) and curated genotype
calls for each cycle of the genomic prediction experiment. Also contains the
genetic map and GoldenPath (proxy for physical position) for each of the
genotyped SNPs from [HarvEST](http://harvest.ucr.edu/), according to the
consensus genetic map from [Muñoz-Amatriaín et al. 2011](https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/tpg/articles/4/3/238).

The parameters for running ALCHEMY are as follows:
- ALCHEMY v. 1.07
- SNP map and probe intensities exported by the GenomeStudio plugin
- Sample map generated by hand, with dummy values for sample ID
- Inbreeding coefficients set to 0.75, expectation after two selfs
- Random seed set to 12345

The curated genotype calls were generated by K. Beaubien.

## A note about sample names
Sample names are built as follows:
- Cycle 1: G10WXXX-YY
    - G: ?
    - 10: 2010 generation
    - W: ?
    - XXX: Three-digit numeric family ID
    - YY: Two-digit numeric line ID
- Cycle 2: MS11S2XXX-YYY
    - M: Minnesota breeding program
    - S: Spring growth habit
    - 11: 2011 generation
    - S2: 2nd generation self (F3 individual)
    - XXX: Three-digit numeric family ID
    - YYY: Three-digit numeric line ID
- Cycle 3: MS12_2XXX-YYY
    - M: Minnesota breeding program
    - S: Spring growth habit
    - 12: 2012 generation
    - 2: 2nd generation self
    - XXX: Three-digit numeric family ID
    - YYY: Three-digit numeric line ID
