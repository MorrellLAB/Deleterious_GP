# Deleterious_GP/Simulation
Source scripts and data for performing the forward-in-time genetic simulation
of deleterious mutations in a breeding program. These will mostly be C++ source
files and Python scripts. The simulation will be performed using the
[fwdpp](https://github.com/molpopgen/fwdpp) library from Kevin Thornton.
